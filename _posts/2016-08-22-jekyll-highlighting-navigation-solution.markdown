Two days ago I tried to set my [website](www.pinglinh.com) navigation in a way where the current tab would be highlighted to show where the user is at. It seemed to be pretty straightforward but alas this was not the case.

My code:

```
HTML
{% raw %}
<a class="page-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aboutme/" {% if page.url == '/aboutme' %} class="current" {% endif %}>About Me</a>
The {% if page.url == ‘/aboutme’ %} class=”current” {% endif %} is Jekyll’s way of saying ‘if the page url renders /aboutme then apply the current class' and then you end your if statement with {% endif %}.

CSS
.current {
   color: #45ADA8;
   background-color: #FFFFFF;
}

{% endraw %}
```

Pretty simple right?

However this did not work and my current class was not applied. Even when trying other combinations with the inspect tool, nothing would work.

Turning to [Eddie](https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude), he realised that I had 2 class attributes in the same html element:

```
class="page-link" and class="current"
```

You can have many classes but they need to be under **one class attribute per html element**.

```
e.g. class="page-link current"
```

When he said this I was literally like ‘oooooooooooooooooohs’ and quickly amended my code to this:

```
<a class="page-link {% if page.url == '/aboutme/' %} current {% endif %}" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aboutme/">About Me</a>
```

And it worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was sooooooooooo thrilled!!! Such a simple yet very important rule 😄

Things to note:

1. My ‘current’ class had to be nested inside ‘page-link’ for it to be active and work.
2. The page.url has to be precise — I tried to do ‘/aboutme’ but it required a forward slash at the end ‘/aboutme/’ as this is the link that Jekyll renders and therefore has to be exactly the same.

That’s it! If you have also came across this problem, I hope I have been able to shed some light 💡.

Massive thank you to [Eddie](https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude) who saw where the issue was in my code. He also came across this before but has now learned how to do it using Jekyll. We both learned something new 🤓.
