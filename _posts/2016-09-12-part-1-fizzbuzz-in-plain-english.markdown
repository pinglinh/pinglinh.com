This is me attempting to explain the printing of the first 20 numbers of FizzBuzz in plain English

I want to write a program which will:

* print the word **Fizz** if the number entered is **divisible by 3**
* print the word **Buzz** if the number is **divisible by 5**
* print the word **FizzBuzz** if the number is **divisible by both 3 and 5**
* print the number entered if the number is not divisible by 3 and 5

We now need to write out our expected answers for the first 20 numbers entered.

1. 1
2. 2
3. Fizz
4. 4
5. Buzz
6. Fizz
7. 7
8. 8
9. Fizz
10. Buzz
11. 11
12. Fizz
13. 13
14. 14
15. FizzBuzz
16. 16
17. 17
18. Fizz
19. 19
20. Buzz

When we have written our code based on the conditions we have set out before and also the answers that we expect, we can check whether our code works by comparing the rendered answer with the expected answers. If we get different answers to our test, this means that we have to go back to our program to fix our code. However if our program does render the correct answers when we input numbers 1â€“20, this means our program is working!
